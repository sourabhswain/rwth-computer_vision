In the earlier parts, we looked at convolution on an image with a single channel in case of grayscale images, or channelwise separate convolutions on RGB images. In CNNs, the multiple input channels of a conv layer are not handled independently, but are linearly combined. This means that the weight array has shape `[kernel_height, kernel_width, num_input_channels, num_output_channels]` and we perform a weighted sum along the channel axis. Another difference is the use of a **bias** vector of shape `[num_output_channels]`, each component of which gets added on the corresponding output channel.\n",

    "Batch normalization is a modern technique to improve and speed up the training of deep neural networks (BatchNorm, Ioffe & Szegedy ICML'15, https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167). Each feature channel is normalized to have zero mean and unit variance across the spatial and mini-batch axes. To compensate for the lost degrees of freedom, extra scaling and bias parameters are introduced and learned. Mathematically, BatchNorm for a spatial feature map (e.g. the output of conv) can be written as:\n",

    "The $\\mu_d$ and $\\sigma_d$ values are computed on the actual mini-batch during training, but at test-time they are fixed, so that the prediction of the final system on a given sample does not depend on other samples in the mini-batch. To obtain the fixed values for test-time use, one needs to maintain moving statistics over the activations during training. This can be a bit tricky to implement from scratch, but luckily this is now implemented in all popular frameworks, including TensorFlow and Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** When applying BatchNorm, it is not necessary to use biases in the previous convolutional layer. Can you explain why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Furthermore, if the BatchNorm is followed by a linear or conv layer (with perhaps a ReLU in between), it is not necessary to use the $\\gamma_d$ factor in BatchNorm (it can be turned off as `layers.BatchNormalization(scale=False)`). Why?"
