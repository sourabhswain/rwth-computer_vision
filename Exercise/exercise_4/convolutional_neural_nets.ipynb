        "Instead of reshaping the input into a long vector, convolutional layers slide small filters across the input, just as with the convolutional filters we saw earlier in the course. In the earlier parts, we looked at convolution on an image with a single channel in case of grayscale images, or channelwise separate convolutions on RGB images. In CNNs, the multiple input channels of a conv layer are not handled independently, but are linearly combined. This means that the weight array has shape `[kernel_height, kernel_width, num_input_channels, num_output_channels]` and we perform a weighted sum along the channel axis. Another difference is the use of a **bias** vector of shape `[num_output_channels]`, each component of which gets added on the corresponding output channel.\n",

        "As you already know, convolution is a linear operator, so it is possible to express any convolutional layer as a fully-connected layer.\n",
        "However, the convolutional layer's weight matrix is sparse (has many zeros) compared to a fully-connected (\"dense\") layer because each output only depends on a small number of inputs, namely, those within a small neigborhood. Further, the weight values are shared between the different pixel locations.\n",

        "## Batch Normalization\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch normalization is a modern technique to improve and speed up the training of deep neural networks (BatchNorm, Ioffe & Szegedy ICML'15, https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167). Each feature channel is normalized to have zero mean and unit variance across the spatial and mini-batch axes. To compensate for the lost degrees of freedom, extra scaling and bias parameters are introduced and learned. Mathematically, BatchNorm for a spatial feature map (e.g. the output of conv) can be written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\mu_d = \\mathbb{E}\\{x_{\\cdot \\cdot d}\\},\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\sigma_d = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}\\{x_{\\cdot \\cdot d}\\}}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "z_{ijd} = \\gamma_d \\cdot \\frac{x_{ijd} - \\mu_d}{\\sigma_d} + \\beta_d,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "with the expectation and variance taken across both the data samples of the batch and the spatial dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The $\\mu_d$ and $\\sigma_d$ values are computed on the actual mini-batch during training, but at test-time they are fixed, so that the prediction of the final system on a given sample does not depend on other samples in the mini-batch. To obtain the fixed values for test-time use, one needs to maintain moving statistics over the activations during training. This can be a bit tricky to implement from scratch, but luckily this is now implemented in all popular frameworks, including TensorFlow and Keras.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q:** When applying BatchNorm, it is not necessary to use biases in the previous convolutional layer. Can you explain why?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q:** Furthermore, if the BatchNorm is followed by a linear or conv layer (with perhaps a ReLU in between), it is not necessary to use the $\\gamma_d$ factor in BatchNorm (it can be turned off as `layers.BatchNormalization(scale=False)`). Why?"
